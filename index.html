    <h2>Professional Overview</h2>
    <p id="summary">
      As an IT Operations Analyst II at Conduent, I leverage my experience in
      Information Technology and my skills in Microsoft Office, WordPress, and
      Microsoft PowerPoint to diagnose and resolve technical hardware and
      software issues. I also follow up with customers and users to ensure
      complete resolution of issues, identify and escalate situations requiring
      urgent attention, and prepare activity reports. Additionally, I inform
      management of recurring problems and train end users on how to use the
      system. In my previous roles, I have gained valuable experience in
      supporting application implementation, quality testing, and bug resolution
      as a Development Operations Support Technician at Visible Supply Chain
      Management. I collaborated directly with developers and end users to
      improve user experience, maintained processes for efficient bug reporting
      and tracking, and managed vendor relationships to ensure cost-effective
      material components. I also led Microsoft Managed Desktop integration and
      assisted in SharePoint management. I am passionate about using technology
      to solve problems and improve business processes.
